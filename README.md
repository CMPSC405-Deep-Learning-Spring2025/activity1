# Activity1

## Due: 10am on January 15, 2025

1. Select an application for a neural network

Example: A neural network must decide whether to approve loan applications.
Come up with a list of mock "features" (e.g., income, credit score, debt-to-income ratio) and "weights" for a basic neural network.

Task:
Students manually calculate a prediction (e.g., approve/deny) for sample data.

Materials:
Sticky notes or cards (for inputs, weights, activations, and outputs).
String or markers to represent connections between layers.
Dice or spinners (to randomly assign weights).
Paper and markers for students to record calculations.
Setup:
Divide the class into groups of 3-4 students.
Assign roles: Inputs, Weights, Neuron Processors, and Outputs.

2. Build a Physical Neural Network Model
   
Working in a group of 2-3, build a mini neural network for your application:

- Use sticky notes or cards for inputs (e.g., "feature 1: 2, feature 2: 5").
- Connect inputs to hidden neurons with "weights" written on cards/notes.
- Assign each neuron a simple activation function, such as a threshold (e.g., "Output 1 if sum > 5, else 0").

2. Simulate Data Flow
   
- Feed example data through your network.
- Multiply inputs by weights, sum the results, and apply the activation function at each neuron.
- Pass the output to the next layer.

Take turns performing calculations to simulate the network.

4. Group Discussion and Refinement
   
Discuss how your network performed. Did the network's output make sense?
How could you adjust weights or activation functions to improve accuracy?

Can you try to add another layer or modify your model and see its effects.

6. Report 

Following given prompts, report on the performance of your network and your reflection on the activity in the `writing/report.md`.
